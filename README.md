# Capacity-of-Massive-MIMO-System

**Resume points:**

Analysing Capacity of a Massive MIMO system | Python | Self Project (Decâ€™22)

(a) Analysed the impact of Power Scaling on capacity by varying the number of antennas at the receiver in a massive MIMO system, comparing scenarios with known CSI to those with receiver-estimated CSI

**Clarifications:**

(a) Please refer "**Massive MIMO Capacity 1.ipynb**" to verify the impact of power scaling on capacity by varying the number of antennas at the receiver in a massive MIMO system,

Please refer **"Massive MIMO Capacity 2.ipynb"** to verify the scenerios with known CSI and receiver estimated CSI.
